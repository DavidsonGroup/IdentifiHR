Description: IdentifiHR is a trained logistic regression model that can predict HR status, being HR deficient (HRD) or HR proficient (HRP), in addition to the probability of a sample being HRD, using only gene expression. IdentifiHR first subsets raw gene expression counts collected from RNA sequencing to only those required for count transcormation and scaling (n = 2604 genes), and then uses the weighted abundances of 209 of these genes to predict HR status in HGSC.
