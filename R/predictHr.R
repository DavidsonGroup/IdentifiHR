#' IdentifiHR
#'
#' The "predictHr" function utilises IdentifiHR, a pre-trained penalised
#' logistic regression classifier, to predict homologous recombination status.
#' While IdentifiHR was trained to classify high-grade serous ovarian
#' carcinomas, it can be applied to other cancer types, though the accuracy of
#' classification will be reduced.
#'
#' @param y A matrix of gene expression counts, with samples presented in rows and genes presented in columns.
#' @param scaled Logical. Has z-score scaling been performed? Default is TRUE, being that the counts matrix has been scaled. If FALSE, z-score scaling of each gene will be performed.
#' @param IdentifiHR The trained HR status predictor
